<!-- The defer attribute tells the browser to load the JavaScript file in parallel with the HTML (non-blocking) and execute it only after 
the HTML document has been completely parsed. This is particularly useful to prevent the browser from pausing HTML parsing while waiting 
for the JavaScript file to load and execute. -->
<!-- If a script needs to be executed immediately (e.g., it modifies content as the page loads or sets up critical logic early), 
defer is not suitable.-->
