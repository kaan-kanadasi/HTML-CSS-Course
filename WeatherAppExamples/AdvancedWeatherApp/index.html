    integrity: Ensures the file has not been tampered with.
    crossorigin="anonymous": Ensures no user credentials are sent in cross-origin requests.
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer": Ensures no referrer information is sent when loading this external resource.

    CROSSORIGIN:
     If you're fetching resources from external servers, crossorigin="anonymous" ensures that no sensitive user information 
     (like session cookies) is sent along with the request. crossorigin ensures that credentials aren't sent to external servers 
     unnecessarily, which protects privacy and mitigates some attack vectors.

    INTEGRITY:
    integrity ensures the file hasn't been tampered with, providing additional security by protecting against data manipulation or 
    injection attacks. How It Works:
        When the browser fetches the file, it calculates its hash.
        It then compares the hash to the one provided in the integrity attribute.
        If the hashes don’t match, the file is blocked, and the browser raises a security warning.

    REFERRER:
    What is the Referer Header?
    When you navigate from one webpage to another, or when a page loads external resources (like scripts, images, or stylesheets), the browser 
    typically includes a Referer header in the HTTP request. This header tells the server where the request is coming from, essentially the URL 
    of the previous page (the page that referred the request).

    For example:

    If you’re on https://example.com and click a link to https://another-site.com, the request to https://another-site.com will include the 
    Referer: https://example.com header, which tells another-site.com where you came from.
    While this information can be useful for tracking, analytics, or user experience purposes, it also introduces privacy and security 
    concerns, especially when the referrer URL contains sensitive information like user IDs or access tokens.
